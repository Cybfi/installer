# Welcome to Cyber Installer!
This is the program that actually installs Cyber onto the user's machine. It is required to do the following:

- [x] Download the files from GitHub
- [ ] Place them in ProgramFiles along with dependencies
- [ ] Gather user information, like Product Key and PIN
- [ ] Configure user accounts that match that product key and force the PIN
- [ ] Install Group Policies and Registry Tweaks based on selected policies
- [ ] Create several ways that Cyber will start on boot
- [ ] Add a simple uninstaller only available to the account that installed Cyber

The Cyber Installer is to be written in [NeutralinoJS](https://neutralino.js.org/) instead of [Electron](https://electronjs.org).
